                                    <td>A very productive Russian heirloom found at the Bird Market in Moscow. ("Azoychka" is a woman's name.). An indeterminate, open-pollinated. regular-leaf tomato plant that produces an abundant crop (40-50 tomatoes per
                                        plant) of smooth, 3-inch, 10-16 oz., slightly flattened oblate, meaty, yellow/orange tomatoes with a luscious sweet citrusy flavor. Azoychka has become one of the favorite in my garden for harvesting a crop for
                                        market. Dependably productive, delicious and deservedly in demand. Unlike most yellow tomatoes this variety has a good acidic balance to its fruity sweetness resulting in lots of robust, complex flavors. A great
                                        variety suited to coastal and both warm to cooler growing regions. Produces well into the season. Great for eating in salads, sliced into a sandwich, cooking in sauces or canning. 68-78 days to maturity. RARE!</td>

                                        Male "The only Brandywine that seems to set fruits well in the south is OTV Brandywine, which is not a strain of Brandywine, but is the result of an accidental cross between Yellow Brandywine and an unknown male
                                        parent." </td>
